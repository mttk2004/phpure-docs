# Introduction to PHPure

PHPure is a simple MVC framework written in PHP to help beginners learn and explore how a web application works under the MVC pattern.

## Meet PHPure

When developing web applications, you'll quickly realize that organizing your code in a structured way is essential. You might start with simple PHP files, but as your application grows, your code will become difficult to maintain and prone to errors. This is why you need a framework. A framework not only provides you with a set of tools to handle common tasks but also helps you follow good software design principles like the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

There are many powerful PHP frameworks out there like Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Zend, Yii, and more. These tools provide numerous useful features, making web application development faster and easier than ever. However, for beginners learning PHP, approaching large frameworks can be challenging. Complex concepts and extensive feature systems can sometimes be overwhelming.

If you're learning PHP or want to understand how a web application works under the MVC pattern, PHPure will be a helpful tool.
