# Directory Structure

The directory structure of **PHPure** is designed to ensure **consistency, comprehensibility, and optimal extensibility**. The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is applied as a foundation, helping to clearly separate the components that handle logic, interface, and data. This not only helps manage the project effectively but also creates a premise for expansion when the application grows.

## Overview

Here's an overview of the PHPure directory structure:

## Key Directories and Files

### App Directory

The `app/` directory contains the main application code that you will work with most often:

- **Controllers/**: Contains the controllers that handle HTTP requests, process input, and return responses. Each controller typically corresponds to a specific resource or section of your application.
- **Listeners/**: Contains event listeners that respond to events triggered throughout the application.
- **Middlewares/**: Contains middleware classes that process HTTP requests before they reach controllers. Middlewares are useful for tasks like authentication, input sanitization, and CSRF protection.
- **Models/**: Contains model classes that interact with the database and represent application data.
- **events.php**: Registers event listeners with the event system.
- **routes.php**: Defines the routes for your application, mapping URLs to controller actions.

### Config Directory

The `config/` directory contains all configuration files for the application:

- **app.php**: Main application configuration including environment settings, error handling, and other global options.
- **cache.php**: Cache configuration including drivers and storage paths.
- **database.php**: Database connection settings.
- **paths.php**: Defines important filesystem paths used throughout the application.
- **phinx.php**: Configuration for the Phinx database migration tool.
- **storage.php**: File storage configuration settings.

### Core Directory

The `core/` directory contains the framework's core components that power your application:

- **Http/**: Contains HTTP-related classes for handling requests and responses.
- **App.php**: The main bootstrap class that initializes and runs the application.
- **Cache.php**: Provides caching functionality to improve application performance.
- **Controller.php**: Base controller class with common controller functionality.
- **Database.php**: Database query builder and connection manager.
- **Model.php**: Base model class with ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities.
- **Twig.php**: Integration with the Twig template engine for rendering views.
- **Validation.php**: Data validation utilities to ensure input data is valid.

### Public Directory

The `public/` directory is the document root for your application. It contains the files that are directly accessible from the web:

- **assets/**: Contains compiled assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **index.php**: The entry point for all HTTP requests to your application.
- **.htaccess**: Apache server configuration for URL rewriting.

### Resources Directory

The `resources/` directory contains raw, uncompiled assets:

- **css/**: CSS source files, possibly using Tailwind or other CSS frameworks.
- **js/**: JavaScript source files.
- **views/**: Twig templates for rendering HTML responses.

### Storage Directory

The `storage/` directory contains files generated by the application:

- **cache/**: File-based cache storage.
- **logs/**: Application log files.
- **uploads/**: User-uploaded files.

### Other Important Files

- **.env**: Contains environment-specific configuration variables.
- **composer.json**: Defines PHP dependencies and autoloading settings.
- **package.json**: Defines JavaScript dependencies and build scripts.
- **tailwind.config.js**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
- **vite.config.js**: Configuration for the Vite front-end build tool.
