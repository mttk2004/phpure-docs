## Meet PHPure

When developing web applications, you'll quickly realize that organizing your code in a structured way is essential. You might start with simple PHP files, but as your application grows, your code will become difficult to maintain and prone to errors. This is why you need a framework. A framework not only provides you with a set of tools to handle common tasks but also helps you follow good software design principles like the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

There are many powerful PHP frameworks out there like Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Zend, Yii, and more. These tools provide numerous useful features, making web application development faster and easier than ever. However, for beginners learning PHP, approaching large frameworks can be challenging. Complex concepts and extensive feature systems can sometimes be overwhelming.

PHPure is a **lightweight and clean framework designed specifically for beginners**. It's simple, intuitive, easy to understand, and easy to use. If you're learning PHP or want to understand how a web application works under the MVC pattern, PHPure will be a helpful tool. Moreover, if you plan to learn larger frameworks like Laravel in the future, understanding how PHPure works will give you a solid foundation for approaching more advanced concepts.

Indeed, PHPure is **inspired by Laravel's structure** but simplified to be more suitable for beginners. As a Laravel enthusiast, the author has tried to bring the most elegant elements of this framework into PHPure to provide the best learning and programming experience.

Not limited to simple web applications, PHPure also has **extensibility and flexibility** to suit your development needs. With a tool like PHPure, your journey of learning and building web applications will be much easier and more enjoyable.
